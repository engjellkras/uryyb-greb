## â‚¬ Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography

<p>- This is a page where is a book about Cryptography. The book is made for deeply understanding Cryptography and new
methods that you can use related to hacking. Cryptography basically is the practice to makin something readable, unreadable.
The term for that is encrypting. Ciphertext is the word for a text that has been encrypted and this is usually done with a key.
The key can be Symmetric which means that thesame key is used for encrypting and also decrypting. Arrymetric key is vice versa so there
are two different keys.</p>
<p>- On the page there is a description of the first chapter of the book. The begining is just explaining terminologyand so on.
Sender and receiver is a term used for the senders and receivers in messages. Usually someone is a sender who wants to send a message
to a receiver, and they then receive a message. A normal text is referredto as plaintext and ecrypted text is Ciphertext.
Below is a picture explained how the encryption/decryprion process usually goes.

## Karvinen 2023: PGP - Send Encrypted and Signed Message - gpg

<p>- In this article there are clear instructions, on how to send encrypted messages onwards. In te article there are instructions on how
to use the gpg tool and so a PGP encryption. The article also says that it is possible to automate the encryption, so that there will
always be a pattern in the way the message will be sent, and it will be very easy to do in the future.</p>
<p>- On the page there are clear command to use for example downloading the gpg encryption tool and also
creating a key.</p>

## Installing OpenSSH server and automation

<p> For some odd reason my Ubuntu does now allow my system to download the openssh.I tried many commands such as sudo apt-get install
 openssh-server and also the same but with -y on the end. These tasks are very hard to complete when the advice is really outdated
and my system does not work. Anyway if this would have worked this is how i would have done it:
sudo apt update, sudo apt install openssh-server -y then for using the ssh i would use sudo systemctl enable ssh for enabling it and
i tried this but it would not work on laptop. </p>

## Pretty Good indeed.
<p>In this task i downloaded the gpg tool for creating keys to the use in encrypting. First i started by downloading
the gpg with the commands $ sudo apt-get update and $ sudo apt-get install gpg micro psmisc to the generating a key pair 
with the command $ gpg --gen-key. Below are some pictures.
